    <p>Yes, this mug is mine.</p>
    <p>Who I am, you ask?</p>
    <p>My name is Dmitry Kustov, sometimes known as Simbiat, and I am sole owner and developer of this website you are on.</p>
    <p>Born in 1989 I hail from a small town \"Moscow\" somewhere in lesser known country \"Russian Federation\".</p>
    <p>I code in PHP and JavaScript, watch anime and TV series and play computer games. I want to make games. Or rather I want to tell stories, but the way I \"see\" those stories requires a visual component and sometimes interactivity, if the story is to deliver more, than just words. I am interested in telling stories revolving around \"unique\" patterns of thinking (psychological component), morality and, generally, one's feelings.</p>
    <p>And... No idea what else you would want to know about me ðŸ˜…</p>
    <p>Fun fact: my \"Simbiat\" alias turned out to be a female name commonly used in Africa and arabian countries. I derived it from \"symbiont\" (specifically those things from \"Spider-Man\" comics), so it felt weird, that it turned out to be a female name as well. Luckily enough it stands for <i>strong woman</i>, so I decided to keep it regardless.</p>
    <p>If you want to learn more about the website itself, check this <a href=\"/about/website/\">section</a>. If you want to check my resume, check this <a href=\"/about/resume/\">one</a>. If you suddenly want to know something else about me, let me know using my <a href=\"/about/contacts/\">contacts</a>.</p>
