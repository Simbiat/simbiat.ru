    <h2>CCPA Privacy Rights (Do Not Sell My Personal Information)</h2>
    <p>Under the CCPA, among other rights, California consumers have the right to request that:</p>
        <ul class="zeroMargin">
            <li>A business that collects a consumer's personal data disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal data that a business has collected about consumers.</li>
            <li>A business delete any personal data about the consumer that a business has collected.</li>
            <li>A business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.</p>
    <h2>GDPR Data Protection Rights</h2>
    <p>We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights. Every user is entitled to the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data. We may charge you a small fee for this service.</li>
        <li>To rectification – You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request that we complete the information you believe is incomplete.</li>
        <li>To erasure – You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li>To restrict processing – You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li>To object to processing – You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
        <li>To data portability – You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please, note, that erasure will not remove user profile itself, as well as [most of] user generated data like forum messages, but all registered personal identification information will be removed or, at least, obfuscated, where removal is not technically possible.</p>
    <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us. If you have previously requested erasure, you can also request profile restoration, if required.</p>
    <h2>Children's Information</h2>
    <p>Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>
    <p>Simbiat Software does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately, and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>
