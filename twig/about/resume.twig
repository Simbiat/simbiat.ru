<section title="Informal introduction">
    <h2>Informal introduction</h2>
    <p>While my "on paper" experience is mainly application support in a bank, in reality I had to take on [portions] of other roles like developer, tester, application manager (akin to product owner), project manager, business/system analyst, security specialist, technical writer, processes architect, supplier manager and "coordinator" for different types of activities related to the above, including multi-department, multi-business and multi-country ones.</p>
    <p>I code for a hobby while posting most of my code on <a href="https://github.com/Simbiat" title="GitHub" target="_blank"><img class="linkIcon" src="/img/social/github.svg" alt="GitHub">GitHub</a>. It is mainly PHP, but you can find some code in JavaScript and Visual Basic (.NET, script and for applications).</p>
    <p>I am empathetic and analytical, which helps with understanding of the feeling of others', where they come from and what they may, potentially, want or, at least, expect. Among other things the combination of these two has found its ways into my prose (and some poems) both in Russian and English. I also have some experience in "level design", which included rooms/caves for <i>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</i> and our guild house in <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i>.</p>
    <p>Besides that I got some level of skill with graphics and video editing, although it's a far cry from what professional editors have.</p>
