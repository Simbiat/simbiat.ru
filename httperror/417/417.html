<p class="error">You are seeing this message, because <a href="https://store.litespeedtech.com/store/aff.php?aff=1965" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="16px" height="16px" class="linkIcon" src="/img/tech/LiteSpeed.svg" alt="LiteSpeed">LiteSpeed</a> does not want to admit an issue with custom error pages not working, when using a dynamic URL (rewrite rules are not applied, if there is no physical file for the URL). The only reason you are able to see this custom page is because I've created a dummy file to force the server apply rewrite rules.</p>
<p class="error">Until LiteSpeed acknowledges (and fixes) the issue, this message will be shown on respective error pages and I will be recommending <i>against</i> this server software.</p>
