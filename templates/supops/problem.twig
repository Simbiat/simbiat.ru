    <p>While there may be many reasons for poor quality of tech support (or customer service in a broader sense), but let's be honest, <em>the root cause</em> in most cases will be lack of investment in the support team, their tools and respective processes. The reason for that is simple: support is seen as an expenditure, something that does not generate any profit. For most businessmen, if something does not generate profit - drop it. If you can't do that for some reason, treat it as "necessary evil" and cut costs as much as possible.</p>
    <p>There is some logic there, indeed. Support teams normally do not "sell" anything, they do not code your program or build your hardware or craft your merchandise, they do not promote it. But it does not mean that they do not affect <em>the perception</em> that your clients have of the product. That perception is extremely difficult to measure, if not outright impossible. Support <em>is</em> part of your product whatever it may be, and often times can be even more important than overall quality of that product.</p>
    <p>Cutting costs can lead to many things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lack of personnel</li>
        <li>Personnel not knowing the product</li>
        <li>Personnel not caring about the product</li>
        <li>Lack of centralized knowledgebase</li>
        <li>Highly repetitive tasks</li>
        <li>Tired personnel</li>
        <li>Unmotivated personnel</li>
        <li>Rude personnel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any and all of these result in poorly handled or even unresolved issues. Get enough of those for each user - they will leave and never look back. Sometimes only 1 instance of poor support will be enough, especially if we are talking about physical products, doubly so, if they are expensive. If you are a monopolist or just one of the few options in your niche or client just <em>has</em> to use your product for whatever reason, they can still stay, but they will not recommend you to their friends and colleagues, and once there is an alternative - will jump ship. Client churn, as you probably know, is something that all business prefer to avoid, but not getting new clients can be even worse for some business at certain stages.</p>
    <p>That's not the only result of poor support, though. It may not be obvious, but support is at the front line of data collection. They are the first that can see patterns of issues, that may not even know about, and places where you are actively losing money. Maybe not directly, but through "time wasted", for example on repetitive tasks, that support team need to do every day, instead of investigating more complex tickets. They can also gather information on how clients use the product and see potential shortcuts that can be implemented in the product, if it's software, or just directly collecting feedback, that can be used to improve the product. You cut off the data flow - it becomes more difficult to improve.</p>
    <p>But most importantly, good support can build <strong>trust</strong>. And trust results in <em>stickiness</em>, which is important for continuous services (whether subscriptions or something that requires periodic purchase). That is a client will less likely to leave, <em>even</em> if you <em>fail</em> at something. Because they know that you will make things better.</p>

    <p>Hopefully, you understand the importance of this, so let's discuss, how we can approach this problem in a smart way.</p>
