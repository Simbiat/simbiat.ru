    <p>Before we discuss the last step of the flow, that is ticket resolution, we need to talk about the tools, that we are using to track progress leading to that resolution. Ideally you have only <em><strong>1</strong></em> ticketing system and you keep the issue in just <em><strong>1</strong></em>. When reassignments are required, you update respective team field in the ticket. In systems like Jira change of a project is acceptable, as long as accessing a ticket with older number will automatically redirect to a ticket with new number. That said, it's not prohibited to use other tickets or tools alongside the main ticket.</p>
    <p>It may be required to raise some tickets as "tasks", for example, when some team needs to do something, they have their own process, and it also needs to be tracked. Features may require their own initiative items or epics, while complex testing may require a whole set of separate items. The important thing is that they are all linked to the main ticket in some way, and important milestones are written not only inside those secondary items, but inside the main ticket as well. Other tools like chats, conferencing tools, whiteboards, etc. can be (and probably should be) used, too, when necessary. The important part is to link all the <em>artifacts</em> to the <strong>main</strong> ticket. Integration and automation are encouraged for this.</p>

    <p>In some cases the whole support flow can be in a chat system. It may be possible to use those for L1 to L3 in some scenarios, although most likely when there is very little segregation between the levels, the total volume if chats per person is very low, and majority of chats get resolved quickly. That said, at least a portion of chats should be "converted" to tickets still. Those that have to go to L4 (whether bug or a feature) for proper tracking or those that do not reach L4, but are relatively complex, so that they are documented internally, at least. Chats would also necessitate a dedicated person of assigning of chats to people, because otherwise there may not be a way to notice common trends indicating a potentially hidden issue or an actual problem.</p>
