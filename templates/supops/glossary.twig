                <summary>L0 (T0)</summary>
                <p>Also known as "Self-Service", is technically not a "level" (hence "0"), since no support specialist is involved, but it's still something that provides the support nonetheless, and is part of the whole flow, thus part of the pipeline. It includes any documentation related to product or service like FAQ, user manual(s), warranty documents, tooltips in software, forums, blogs, lists of known issues or limitations, changelogs, previous tickets (if public), chatbots, etc. Essentially, this is everything that can constitute a knowledgebase, and tools that enhance its usability. Used before a support specialist is involved, but can be relied on by specialists, as well. Can be split into 2 sublevels, L0 Static (knowledgebase and the like), and L0 Conversational (forums, chatbots). Discussed further <a href="/supops/l0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
