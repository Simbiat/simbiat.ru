    <p>The flow starts with the user. If they do not have any issues with our product - they are happy (at least with the product). But if not - they may want to try to resolve things themselves. Or, at least, they should, if you have available resources, that make up <em>L0 support</em>, something that is often overlooked. Depending on the issue just error message text and/or tooltips in the application itself may be enough for the user. If not, it's best to have easily accessible knowledgebase, that the user can search through to find potential explanation of the issue, as well as steps to fix and prevent it. If that does not help, and you have some sort of community (like a forum), they may try asking there. If your community is active, that may be the end of it.</p>
    <p>The catch is... You need to <em>participate</em> in that community. You need to monitor it, you need to answer questions there, and potentially curate threads, if they identify big issues (you may "pin" them for visibility, but at least don't hesitate to create a ticket yourself). Same is true for chatbots: even if they help users, be sure to monitor contents of the chats to identify potential trends and bots' hallucinations. Knowledgebase (KB) articles are not that different: you need to keep them up-to-date, based on tickets' resolutions and changes in the product. Use of content management systems designed for KB articles is strongly recommended, since they can help with organizing things, with versioning, with scheduled publications, access management and even some tracking (changes and SEO).</p>

    <p>I won't be getting into how you write a good KB article, there are plenty of resources about that, though. What is important, is that people involved in a resolution of each individual issue are responsible for updating relevant parts of L0. It can be people from support team, if it's something simple (updated screenshot, correction of mistype). For something a bit more complex a technical writer could be a better fit. Documentation which is purely internal can be handled by developers or their team leads, if that's how your organization is structured, but it is still better to use a technical writer (after some sync with developers).</p>
    <p>If all fails on L0, customer will need to contact a human. You better have an easy way to do that inside the app. It may not be a form itself, it may just be a link to a webpage with a form, that they then submit. Ensure, that whatever script used to submit the form is always working, so that there is a guarantee, that it will reach you. The moment the message reaches your system - create a ticket, ideally automatically using the data provided. If the user was chatting with a chatbot, create a ticket the moment connection to a human is requested. Now we are on L1.</p>
