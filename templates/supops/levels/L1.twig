    <p><b>Level 1</b> is a taxing job, because of direct communication with users, especially, if done in an online chat or via phone. Yes, a lot of issues at this stage are "stupid", someone missed, misread, misunderstood, miss-clicked something. One may think that it's fine to just turn off your brain for these cases, especially due to sheer numbers of those. But in that case you become like a chatbot, and thus can have biases and even hallucinations. Which can not only hide potential incidents (and problems), but also aggravate users.</p>
    <p>The main goal here is to gather as much information about the issue as possible. If you ever got a seemingly standardized set of questions after contacting support, you essentially know what a "script" is: a questionnaire, possibly multiple ones or one that is branching out, that helps with the task. Unfortunately, they are often too rigid and get abused due to tight time constraints and stress, turning specialists into zombies, checking items off a checklist and missing nuance. Avoid that! Instead, promote templates of questions, both common for the whole team and customized for each individual specialist.</p>
    <p>Don't just copy-paste the list of answers from your script. Custom pre-saved responses can be very helpful, but do try to tailor them based on the information that the user already provided you with. Try to assess the knowledge level of the user, too, and adjust your language. If uncertain - just ask if they are familiar with something or not, and explain things, if required. It is possible that the explanation will resolve the issue, and if not, it will level-up the user (especially useful in case you do have a community, where users can help each other). It is also important to let the user know what you are doing, that you are checking system A or B to see something, checking knowledgebase or checking with your colleagues (it's ok to admit that you may not know something or are unsure of something, just don't be overly blatant about it). Doubly so, if you need to transfer the ticket to another person or team.</p>

    <p>The discussion itself may not start with a ticket right away depending on means of communication, but it should always result in one, even if it ended up being a direction to some knowledgebase article or something equally simple, at least for purposes of statistics and detecting patterns. You will always start with ticket in <em>New</em> (or <em>L1 New</em> to help differentiate between levels) status (which should result in automated notification to the team, unless ticket was created by an agent), then move it to <em>Assigned</em>, when there an agent assigned to it, and to <em>In Progress</em>, when agent is actively working it. While working on the ticket, some question may arise, that require answers in order to proceed.</p>
    <p>If answers can be provided by the user - ask them, and put the ticket into "Waiting for User" or similar status. Once the user replies, revert the status back to "In Progress". Response from the user does not necessarily mean that your questions will be answered, or you can get new questions, so you can get into a small loop here. Point is to get as many answers, as you can. Do not wait indefinitely, though. It is a good practice to have a "timeout" for user response, and also follow-up multiple times before it reaches 0. If it does reach 0 - resolve the ticket. This is required, because you can't have unlimited number of tickets assigned to each specialist, even if they are just waiting for the user. You will start noticing mental load with 6 to 10 tickets already.</p>

    <p>If answers are required from some other group, like an internal team or 3rd party - put the ticket into "Waiting for Other Group" or similar status. This one may not require a <em>strict</em> timeout, but you still should not keep the ticket in this status indefinitely and follow-up the respective teams or even have SLAs for teams' response (for example 24 hours for internal teams, 48 hours for 3rd parties). For some teams it can make sense to have a rotating dedicated person, that will prioritize responding to requests from support specialists. If getting the answer will take too long, it may be a good idea to return the ticket back to "In Progress" and then either resolve or escalate the ticket <b>L2</b>.</p>
