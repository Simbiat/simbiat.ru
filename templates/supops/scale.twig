    <p>The whole flow may seem overwhelming, at first, overly complex. But in reality it has duplicated sections that enforce standard "sub-flows" across levels. In fact, if you have a smaller company you can easily collapse L1, L2 and L3 into 1. That would mean that you remove levels 1 and 2. Even if you just have 1 team that handles both development <em>and</em> support (not ideal) - you just use L4 from the diagram.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, note, that not all issues will go through all levels. A common scenario: L2 specialist notices something, confirms that it's abnormal behavior, and then they raise the ticket directly to L3 (or L3 raises it directly to L4). It is also possible, that L1 has been notified about a known issue, already escalated to L4, and thus they will close the ticket as duplicate. Or it is so clear that reported issue is a bug, that it will go directly from L1 to L4. That is why it is recommended to have a dedicated person assigning tickets, because they may be able to apply such a "shortcut" if needed, and that's why <em>Assigned</em> is a separate status.</p>

    <p>But even if you do have just 1 team, it may be a good idea to have some sort of rotation, where each member works as one of the respective levels, for a short period of time, instead of everyone doing everything all the time. Let's say one person focuses on L1 for a week, then on L2 for the next week, and L3 for the next one, and L4 for the last week of the cycle. Note the use of the word <em>"focuses"</em>: it does not mean that previous tickets for lower level support are completely ignored, it means that new tickets from higher levels can potentially take higher priority. Overall prioritization will still depend on available resources and criticality of all the ongoing issues.</p>
