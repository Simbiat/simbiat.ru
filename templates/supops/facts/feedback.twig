    <h2>📌 Principle</h2>
    <p>Feedback</p>
    <h2>❓ What</h2>
    <p>Everyone involved in the issue-resolution cycle must know the ticket's status at every step. All product stakeholders should be able to propose improvements to the product and its supporting processes. A robust feedback loop drives idea sharing, issue reporting, and ultimately more product improvements and trust - even when ideas are rejected or resolutions take time.</p>
    <h2>🪙 Business impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users' churn</li>
        <li>Agents' workload</li>
        <li>Issues' discoverability</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>❌ Poor implementation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Discourages issue reporting and idea sharing: "No one does anything".</li>
        <li>Increases ticket duplicates: "Don't know if this has been reported by me or anyone else".</li>
        <li>Misses or under-reports potential patterns of existing and future issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>✅ Good implementation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boosts issue reporting and patience with long resolutions.</li>
        <li>Cuts duplicates by keeping public list of known issues.</li>
        <li>Speeds product improvements through timely information sharing between teams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow each user to see all the tickets submitted by that user.</li>
        <li>Have a public list of known issues, if you do not have a ticketing system which is public by default.</li>
        <li>Use forums and/or periodic surveys to gather ideas and pain-points from end-users.</li>
        <li>If using internal ticketing system allow all internal users to see all the tickets by default, hide only tickets with sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Be open to receive and track ideas and general feedback from internal users.</li>
        <li>Consider involving your Product Team in periodic review or even participation in active support.</li>
        <li>Notify about critical issues both external users and stakeholders. Exclude from external communications security-related issues, that are not yet fixed.</li>
        <li>Automate notifications about status updates of issues.</li>
