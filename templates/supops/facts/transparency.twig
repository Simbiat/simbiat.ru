    <h2>📌 Principle</h2>
    <p>Transparency</p>
    <h2>❓ What</h2>
    <p>Do not hide things from your users. List known limitations on a page, possibly direct to it before user contacts support. List bugs that can be affecting a lot of users (or even all known bugs), and direct to that list as well. If you make a mistake - be open and humble about it: this builds trusts with your users, and trust is a feature, that is not easily replicable by competitors. This does not mean that you forget security and privacy good practices and laws like GDPR, though.</p>
    <h2>🪙 Business impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Duplicate or unnecessary tickets</li>
        <li>Poor communication lines</li>
        <li>Users' trust</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>❌ Poor implementation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Increases load on agents through duplicate tickets.</li>
        <li>Blindsides users and stakeholders about critical issues.</li>
        <li>Deteriorates trust.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>✅ Good implementation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces number of duplicate tickets.</li>
        <li>Raises awareness of limitations and ongoing issues.</li>
        <li>Builds trust, that you can do the right thing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="float_clear">🛠️ Common tools</h2>

    <h2>💡 Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Have clearly defined process to notify both stakeholders and users about critical issues and status updates regarding those, while keeping track of notifications' history (what, when, to whom, etc.).</li>
        <li>Define criteria for assigning respective <em>priority</em> and <em>severity</em> to a ticket, that are used universally across all organization (bonus points, if they are made public).</li>
        <li>If possible make your ticketing system public (like <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JetBrains</a> did, for example).</li>
        <li>If whole ticketing system can't be made public, have a list of current known bugs and update it regularly (ideally make the bugs from the ticketing system public selectively).</li>
        <li>If security issue was found and fixed - disclose it, thanking the reporter, if it was someone from outside the company.</li>
        <li>Have blog posts discussing complex features or issues resolved by respective teams.</li>
        <li>Where possible, make code of the software parts of your product public.</li>
        <li>Register ideas as tickets or similar items, to which tickets can be linked: this will also help prioritize them.</li>
        <li>Consider beta-test programs with end-users, to show what you are doing and why, as well as to build trust.</li>
    </ul>
