    <p>SupOps is not a completely new concept. It draws inspiration from several well‑known frameworks, but tailors them for the unique challenges of tech‑support. Below is a quick side‑by‑side view.</p>

                <td>Overlaps on automation, monitoring, RCA; SupOps adds the customer‑facing side (L0‑L4).</td>
                <td>Shares proactive outreach & feedback, but CS rarely defines ticket‑level processes or L0 self‑service.</td>
                <td>Philosophy aligns with SupOps "continuous loop", but Kaizen is a generic mindset, not a concrete support workflow</td>
